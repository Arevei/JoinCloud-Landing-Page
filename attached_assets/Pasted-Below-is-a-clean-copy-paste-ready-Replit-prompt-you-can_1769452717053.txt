Below is a **clean, copy-paste–ready Replit prompt** you can use to generate the **JoinCloud landing page** exactly in the direction we discussed.

This is written as a **developer instruction prompt**, not marketing copy.

## Replit Prompt — JoinCloud Landing Page

**Project Context**

You are building the **JoinCloud landing page** for a personal cloud networking platform.
JoinCloud lets users share files globally **directly from their own device**, without uploading to third-party cloud storage.

This page is **marketing + download only**.
There must be **NO web login, NO dashboard, NO authentication UI**.

The goal is:

* Explain the product clearly
* Build trust
* Drive macOS beta downloads

---

### Tech Requirements

* Framework: **Next.js (App Router preferred)** or **React + Vite**
* Styling: **Tailwind CSS**
* Dark theme only
* Fully responsive
* Static page (no backend required)

---

### Design System (must be followed exactly)

#### Colors

```txt
Background: #0A0A0F
Surface/Card: #12121A
Primary (CTA): #2FB7FF
Text Primary: #FFFFFF
Text Muted: #A1A1AA

Status (define but do not heavily use):
Success: #22C55E
Warning: #F59E0B
Error: #EF4444
```

#### Typography

* Font: **Inter**
* Headline: 48–56px, semibold
* Section titles: 28–32px
* Body text: 16–18px
* Muted text: 14–16px

---

### Page Structure (Required Sections)

#### 1. Header

* Logo (JoinCloud)
* Minimal navigation (Documentation optional)
* Primary CTA button: **Download for macOS**
* Transparent initially, solid surface on scroll

---

#### 2. Hero Section

* Dark background with **subtle radial gradient glow** (blue/purple tint, low opacity)
* Headline:

  > Your personal cloud.
  > Powered by your own device.
* Subtext:

  > Share files globally, directly from your system — without uploading to third-party storage.
* Primary CTA:
  **Download for macOS (Beta)**
* Secondary muted text:

  > Web access coming soon

---

#### 3. How It Works

Three cards (responsive grid):

1. Install JoinCloud on your Mac
2. Select files or folders to share
3. Share instantly with anyone, anywhere

Cards:

* Background: #12121A
* Rounded corners
* Subtle border or shadow

---

#### 4. Why JoinCloud

List or grid explaining differentiation:

* No cloud storage duplication
* Files stay on your device
* Direct, fast sharing
* Secure encrypted connections
* Full user control

Use subtle blue accents, not icons overload.

---

#### 5. Security & Trust

Short, calm section:

* Emphasize privacy
* No exaggerated crypto claims
* No technical jargon

---

#### 6. Download Section

* Repeat primary CTA
* Show:

  > macOS • v0.3.3 Beta
* Mention “Beta” subtly using warning color if needed

---

#### 7. Footer

* Surface background
* Links:

  * Privacy Policy
  * Terms
  * Support
* No admin links
* No login links

---

### UX & Motion Rules

* No heavy animations
* Subtle hover effects only
* 150–200ms transitions
* No autoplay effects

---

### Important Constraints (Do NOT violate)

* ❌ No login/signup UI
* ❌ No web dashboard
* ❌ No screenshots of internal app
* ❌ No device IDs or auth concepts
* ❌ No promises of web access beyond “coming soon”

This is an **app-first product**, not a SaaS dashboard.

---

### Output Expectations

* Clean component structure
* Reusable Button, Card, Section components
* Well-organized Tailwind classes
* Production-ready landing page

---

**Start by scaffolding the project and building the landing page UI according to the above instructions.**

---

If you want, next I can:

* Convert this into a **Cursor prompt**
* Provide a **Tailwind token config**
* Review Replit’s output and refine it to production quality

Just tell me the next step.
